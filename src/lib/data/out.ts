When you complete a challenge, randomize for a new challenge, using <a href=\"https://plane-latency.vercel.app/challenges\">link</a>.","For every challenge you must take a photo/video as proof that you completed the challenge. Afterwards, send the photo and challenge name to your opponents in the relevant Discord channel.","If you would like another challenge option, you can veto a challenge, whereby you must stay in the same place for 15 minutes and you cannot complete any challenges.","If you've completed or vetoed a challenge, you can't do it again.","At any point you are allowed to walk away from your current station/bus stop as long as you walk back to it for no cost. This will be very useful for most challenges.","There are 3 teams. There are two types of team: Harvesters and Crops. At all points in the game, there are 2 teams of type Harverster, (2 Harvesters) and 1 team of type Crop (1 Crop).","Only the Crop needs to pay coins to move, and only the Crop can complete challenges.","The Harvesters have access to the Crop's location, but the Crop does not have access to the Harvesters' location.","The Harvesters work in collaboration to try to \"harvest\" the Crop by physically tapping on any part of a Crop team member. If a Harvester harvests the Crop, then the next team in the Crop Rotation becomes the new Crop (and the old Crop becomes a Harvester).","Each team also has an target location; whenever a team is a Crop, they attempt to move towards their location. If at any point a Crop reaches their target location, they win.","Each team has a crop as its name. The names of teams are: Fish, Apple, and Applesauce. Fish's target location is Fisherman's Wharf Musée Mécanique entrance. Apple's target location is Legion of Honor Museum Gift Store. Applesauce's target location is Glen Canyon Creeks to Peaks North Trailhead.","At the beginning of the game, a draft order is randomly selected. There will be two rounds in the draft. For their pick, a team may either select an target location or a place in the Crop Rotation. If in the first round of the draft, a team picks an target location, in the second round, they must pick a place in the Crop Rotation, and vice versa.","At the end of the game, if no Crop has reached the target location, the team whose target location is closest to the current Crop wins."]

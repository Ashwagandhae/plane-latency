			For every challenge you must take a photo/video as proof that you completed the challenge.
			Afterwards, send the photo and challenge name to your opponents

			At any point you are allowed to walk away from your current station/bus stop as long as you
			walk back to it for no cost

			challenge in your hand at the same time and you cannot receive any challenges you have already
			completed. Rerandomize in this case
